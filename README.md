# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A machine learning project using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health attributes. The main goal of the project was to build a predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis, helping healthcare professionals take timely preventive measures.


# ðŸš€ Model & Evaluation

The core of this project is a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. The model's performance was evaluated on the dataset, achieving the following result:

Accuracy: 85.33%

Further evaluation metrics, including a detailed Confusion Matrix and Classification Report, are available within the project's analysis notebook.

# ðŸ“Š Key Features & Visualizations

This repository includes a complete data analysis workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the UCI dataset for modeling.

Correlation Heatmap: A visualization to understand the relationships between different medical attributes.

Model Training: Implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm.

ROC Curve: A graphical plot illustrating the diagnostic ability of the classifier.

# ðŸ’¡ Future Scope

This project serves as a strong baseline. Future development could include:

Model Comparison: Implementing and evaluating other classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) to compare performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters using techniques like GridSearch CV to potentially improve accuracy.

Web Application: Deploying the trained model as a simple web application (using Streamlit or Flask) for interactive predictions.
