# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A machine learning project using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health attributes. The main goal of the project was to build a predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis, helping healthcare professionals take timely preventive measures.
